# Amazon-Webpage
This project is a static replica of the Amazon homepage, developed using HTML and CSS. It showcases a clean and structured layout with sections such as a navigation bar, product display areas, and a footer, mimicking the basic design and functionality of the Amazon website.

While the page is static and does not have dynamic functionality, it highlights my ability to implement web page structure, design principles, and styling techniques using foundational web technologies.

Key Features:
Navigation Bar: Links to different sections (home, product categories, etc.)

Product Sections: Display areas for featured products

Footer: Contact and site information

Responsive Layout: (Not yet implemented, but intended for future development)

This project is intended to demonstrate fundamental web development skills in HTML and CSS.
